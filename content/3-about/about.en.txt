Bio: 

## Pierre Le Leuch

<p><script>displayage(1981, 1, 1, "years old", 0, "rounddown")</script></p>

Passionate about management in all its forms, I’ve been practicing corporate coaching and supporting management teams for 6 years. I had the chance to intervene in various sectors (luxury, retail, media) and enriching contexts (hyper-growth, PSE, trade union issues). I have a geeky edge and I’m always eager to understand the changes that surround us, I’ve specialized in new technologies and start-ups sectors.

Before that, I had a 7-year long professional life in the world of corporate finance, in law firm and financial management, in international contexts (Mexico, New York City).

In 2008, I witnessed History by seeing through my office windows Lehman Brothers employees coming out with their cardboard. I thought it was the end of an era! ;)

Today, when I'm not working, I take advantage of my other passions to relax: kite surfing, stand-up (shows, not paddle), comics, social sciences (books, podcasts, lectures ..) and video games.

Trilingual English-Spanish-French
